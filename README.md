## Deep Learning Library
![gallery](assets/crop-circles-compressed.jpg)

## ðŸš€ Features
- **PyTorch based**: The library is based on pure PyTorch with utilities, layers and data manipulation.
- **Researches**: All deep models inspired by articles on tabular data from arxiv.org
- **Tabular problems**: The library is attempting to solve tabular data problems applying deep approaches surpassing regular GBDTs (Gradient Boosted Desicion Trees).
- **Data manipulation**: The library includes a set of utilities to manipulate data, including data augmentation, data preparation and so on.
- **Model selection**: The library includes a set of models that can be used to solve various problems.
- **Easy-to-use**: The library is attempting to unify deep learning decisions for building a single scikit-like API.
- **Parallel universe!**: Currently the main module (RiegelRing) can be run in parallel using Horovod.


## :blue_book: Contents
* *deeplayers*: Small collection of deep layers that can be implemented in models
* *deeplib*: Collection of helper modules for data preparation, augmentation, metrics eval and on.
* *models*: Models available to use, adapted from / inspired by arxiv.org (links included). Navigate to models/README.md to access guidelines 
* *utils*: Data preparation tools (without digging deep)
* *parallel.sh*: Single script to run Horovod (may cause problems)
