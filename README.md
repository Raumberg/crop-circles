## ðŸŒŸ Available Models
I am proud to present a collection of cutting-edge models designed to tackle various tabular data challenges. Each model is inspired by the latest research and optimized for performance. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the models included in the library:
- **SAINT**: A powerful model that combines the strengths of attention mechanisms (`SelfAttn` and `IntersampleAttn`) to effectively capture complex relationships in tabular data between numerical and categorical variables. Ideal for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of feature interactions.
- **DANet**: This model leverages its own `AbstractLayer` to enhance feature representation, making it particularly effective for datasets with intricate patterns. DANet excels in scenarios where context and relationships between features are crucial.
- **SuperForest**: A hybrid model that integrates the robustness of ensemble methods with deep learning techniques. SuperForest is designed to outperform traditional models by intelligently combining predictions from multiple sources.
- **RiegelRing**: Inspired by transformer architectures, RiegelRing is tailored for tabular data, enabling it to learn from patterns and dependencies. This model is perfect for tasks that benefit from a transformerâ€™s ability to handle complex interactions. RiegelRing is a `Top Frontier` deep tabular model according to arxiv.org
- **TANDEM**: The **Temporal Aberrated Neural Differentiable Embedding Mechanism** (TANDEM) is designed to capture temporal dynamics in tabular data. By incorporating weight and gradient noise, TANDEM enhances robustness and generalization. This model is particularly effective for tasks that require understanding of temporal relationships and variations in data, making it a valuable addition to your deep learning toolkit.
